# RL Algorithms for OpenAI Gym Environments
\* *Created for an assignment for Topics in Reinforcement Learning, IIITH, Spring 2023* \*

 - `q1.ipynb` contains Value Iteration and Policy Iteration based solutions to OpenAI CliffWalking-v0.
 - `q2.ipynb` contains solutions to OpenAI Taxy-v3 implemented using Q-Learning, SARSA, On-policy Monte Carlo and Off-Policy Monte Carlo learning. 
 - Both the notebooks contain graphs showing convergence of the reward function as the model approaches the optimal policy.
